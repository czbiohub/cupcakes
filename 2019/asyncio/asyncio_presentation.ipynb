Beacause most of these chunks are independent, I can start a task and instead of waiting for it to finish, I can start another task while i wait for the original task to complete, potentially saving me lots of time. In computing chunks of functionality that behave like this are called **coroutines**.\n"

    "\n",
    "* an `async def` function is able to use `await`, `return`, or `yield` \n",

    "* You can only use `await` inside the body of an async coroutine.\n",
    "* To await an object, that object itself must be _awaitable_ (aka another coroutine)\n",
    "* For design, coroutines are usually kept as small and modular as possible and are called with another wrapper function to chain co-routines together. `main()` is typically used to gather tasks and apply central co-routine across an iterable or pool.\n",
